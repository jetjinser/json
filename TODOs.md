# TODOs

- [ ] all tests pass
- [ ] viable benchmark
- [ ] use some mutable status, maybe could improve perf by reducing alloc
- [ ] better Error by providing Error Context
- [ ] figure out how to re-export variants of enum `Value`, now `jinser/json/tests` must imports `jinser/json/lib`, which is unintented.
